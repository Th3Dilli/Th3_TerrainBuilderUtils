# Th3_TerrainBuilderUtils

This tool allows you to import your Terrain Builder object files (.txt) into Enfusion with the help of an integrated mapping table you will have to map objects from TB to Enfusions prefabs.

Using the same mapping table you can also export from Enfusion to Terrain Builder format.

Those mapping tables can also be exportet to file and imported again.
One bug atm is that the UI table will not update when importing the mapping table from file again. To still check whats on the mapping table there is a function to print it to console.

WARNING
This tool in its very early stage, to be sure not to break or loose your current progress make a copy of your map or create sub scene and test it there first.
